Rust 100 Days — Foundations for Krea8
Overview

This repository documents my 100-day Rust learning sprint, focused on building a strong foundation in Rust fundamentals, systems thinking, and full-stack Rust development (including Yew).

The purpose of this work is not academic.
It serves as technical preparation for building Krea8, a Web3 platform for documenting ownership, rights, and value exchange across the creative industry.

Each directory represents a focused mini-project or concept explored during the journey.

Why Rust

Rust was chosen for this learning path because of its strengths in:

Memory safety without garbage collection

Strong compile-time guarantees

Explicit ownership and borrowing models

Reliability for security-sensitive and financial systems

Growing adoption in Web3, blockchain, and systems engineering

These properties make Rust well-suited for platforms that model ownership, rights, and irreversible transactions.
